# Grammy Awards Categories Mapping

## Data Source
The official Grammy Awards categories were extracted from [DBpedia](https://dbpedia.org/page/List_of_Grammy_Award_categories).

## Mapping Process
During the analysis of the `the_grammy_awards.csv` dataset, we discovered discrepancies between the categories in the file and the official ones. The main differences involved:
- Non-standardized formatting
- Presence of special characters
- Variations in naming conventions

To ensure accurate data correspondence, we used ChatGPT to create a precise mapping between:
- The categories found in the CSV file
- The official categories from DBpedia

This approach allowed us to standardize and normalize the categories, facilitating data analysis and processing.
