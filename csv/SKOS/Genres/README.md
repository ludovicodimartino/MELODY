# Music Genre Classification

The system organizes musical genres into a hierarchical structure of macro-categories to simplify classification. Each genre, obtained from the artists.csv file, is associated with a macro-category based on its main musical genre.

### Example of Macro-category: Pop
The "Pop" macro-category includes numerous related subgenres, such as:
- Acoustic Pop
- Afropop
- Alternative Pop
- [other subgenres...]

### Specific Genres Management
Some highly specific or niche music genres don't fit into the main macro-categories. Examples include:
- 8-bit
- A Cappella
- Abstract Beats
- Acoustic OPM

These genres are collected in the "Unclassified" category to ensure complete cataloging while maintaining the integrity of the main structure.

The musical genres have been exported to an XLSX file to enable their import as individuals into Protégé through the Cellfie plugin.
